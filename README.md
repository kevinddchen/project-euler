# project-euler

This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler problems. 
Please do not blindly copy numerical answers.

Many `.py` files run on Python 2.7.

The `.cxx` files can be run using [run.sh](solutions/run.sh) or the Makefile.

[EulerSolutions.pdf](EulerSolutions.pdf) contains write-ups for interesting problems and problems that can be solved by hand.
