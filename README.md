# project-euler

These are my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. 
Please do not blindly copy numerical answers.

To run any solution, use 
```
./run.sh ###
```
where `###` is replaced by an integer.
If the solution is written in C++, this will compile and run the code.
If the solution is written in Python, this will run the code using the command `python p###.py`.
Note that `python` must point to Python 3.
The only eternal package used is numpy, although only rarely for matrix manipulations.

[EulerSolutions.pdf](EulerSolutions.pdf)  contains write-ups for problems that are can be solved by hand or are interesting.
