# project-euler

These are my solutions to Project Euler problems. 
Please do not blindly copy numerical answers.

Many `.py` files run on Python 2.7, as they were written many years ago.

The `.cxx` files can be compiled and executed using [run.sh](solutions/run.sh) or the Makefile.

[EulerSolutions.pdf](EulerSolutions.pdf)  contains write-ups for problems that are can be solved by hand or are interesting.
