By playing around, you can convince yourself that for all m, n > 1:

    S(n, n) = 8n - 11
    S(m, n) = 6(m - n) + 8n - 13 , m > n
    S(m, n) = S(n, m)

Now we want to find solutions where S(m, n) = p^2. First off, we can rule out
solutions for p=2 by checking this case by hand, so we can assume without loss
of generality that p is odd. Since p^2 = 1 (mod 8) for all odd primes p, we
note that cannot have S(n, n) = p^2. Thus, for each prime 2 < p < 1,000,000, we
try to find all solutions to

    p^2 + 13 = 6a + 8n

where n > 1 and a > 0. Because p is odd, we can actually divide both sides by 2.
