We start by computing the bit representation of each prime number and putting
them into a binary tree, e.g. the left branch is a '0' bit and the right branch
is a '1' bit.

Once we have a tree, we note that at any node of the tree, the optimal strategy
is to pick the bit with most primes down that branch. For instance, if a node
has n0 primes down the '0' branch and n1 primes down the '1' branch, then the
optimal choice is the larger of n0 and n1. This is because since all primes are
uniformly distributed, the probability of the drawn prime number being in the
'0' branch is n0 / (n0 + n1).

If the probabilities of the branches are p0 and p1, respectively, then the
expected score for the node can be written in terms of the expected scores of
the child nodes:

    E(node) = p0 * E(0) + p1 * E(1) + max(p0, p1)

This can be computed via depth-first traversal.
