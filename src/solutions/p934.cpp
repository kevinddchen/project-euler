The general strategy is instead of doing the brute-force computation, instead we figure out, given a prime p, the values
of n <= limit where u(n) = p. This is best demonstrated by looking for the pattern.

First, we note that u(n) = 2 for all odd n. This means that for all even n, u(n) > 2.

Of the even n, we note that u(n) = 3 for all n = 2, 4 (mod 6). This means that for all n = 0 (mod 6), u(n) > 3.

With this we can start to see a pattern emerge:
 - u(n) = 5 for all n = 6, 12, 18, 24 (mod 30)
 - u(n) = 7 for all n = 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 (mod 210)

However, when we look at p=11, we see a new emergent phenomenon. We note that at this moment of time we are
only considering n = 0 (mod 210). We can note that u(n) = 11 for all n = 210, 420, 630, ... (mod 2310) but NOT for
n = 1470 (mod 2310) because 1470 % 11 = 7 is divisible by 7. This means that when we are looking at p=13, we are
considering n = 0 and 1470 (mod 2310). In fact, as the primes we consider increase, the number of "remainders" we have
to consider also increase. For example, for p=17 we are considering n = 0, 13020, 18480, and 24570 (mod 30030).
